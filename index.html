                <h2> Previous Work Experience</h2>
                <p> I have worked for the JCC at manhattan day camp for three years. At this camp I would work in groups of around twenty campers with three or four other counselors. We would do sports, science, singing, and arts and crafts throughout the day. I would also help teach the campers how to swim by giving them lessons with a swim instructor every day. In addition to working at the JCC I also worked at a summer camp on Long Island for a summer where I had the same responsibilties in addition to being a bus counselor. A bus counselor is someone who gets on the bus with the kids every morning and makes sure they are picked up and dropped off at the right time as well as making sure they don't feel too home sick when they leave their parents.</p>
                <p> I addition to being a camp counselor for four years I used to be an assistant teacher for a local hebrew school. I would come in once a week and help the kids learn how to read and write in hebrew.</p>

I have spent the past four years developing my programming skills and am able to created programs to do simple tasks that someone may need to be accomplished.</p>
                <p> I have also helped tutor my sister for her statewide high school exams. I have tutored her in history, math, chemistry, and physics to help prepare her for these tests.</p>
